OLE Plugin Configuration Proof-Of-Concept
==========================================

Contains a demonstration of how to implement a plugin for a Spring-configured
web application.

This project includes both a complete (if tiny) Spring MVC web application and includes,
 alongside that, code in a different (Java) package that adds functionality to the base
 MVC application.

The aim is to illustrate how, with minor modifications, medium to large web applications
could support plugin functionality, allowing different development teams to add or
modify existing functionality without having to modify a centrally managed codebase.
